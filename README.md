What the hell is Bootlacer?

Bootlacer is a quick way for avid Bootstrap users to generate projects on their servers. Simply run the script and include your project name
for example: sh bootlacer.sh MyNewProject

The folder will be created and you will have a Bootstrap setup. You then can generate a bare bones page and add other CDN hosted libraries to your project.


# I am lazy and got sick of doing this. Maybe other people will use this too.

I dont care what you do with this script. Just don't try to sell it (not sure who buys my awful code) and don't claim it as your own please.















I really only did this for Twitter followers....
