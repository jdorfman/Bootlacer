What the hell is Bootlacer?

Bootlacer is a quick way for avid Bootstrap users to generate projects on their servers. Simply run the script and include your project name
for example: sh bootlacer.sh MyNewProject

I dont really care what you do with this script. I only ask you don't sell it or claim it as your own. I only wrote it becuase I got lazy from loading bootstrap everytime and adding CDN links. After launching a project quickly for someone and them seeing my laptop (Damn peekers), they asked to share this. A twitter follower or comment would be cool if you use this for something.

Script will download latest bootstrap version, create a project folder, and give you options to create a base template and add a range of CDN script libraries into your page automatically.

Again.... I am lazy and got sick of doing this.

# USAGE
     -Set your directory below where you want all projects created under. Typical WWW root.
     -Run script with your project name after it. Example: sh bootlacer.sh mynewproject
     -The "mynewproject" folder will be created for you.
     -YOu will have options to create a barebones page and add librarires

ADDITIONAL LIBRARIES YOU CAN ADD

     -Prototype        http://prototypejs.org/
     -Chromeframe      http://developers.google.com/chrome/chrome-frame/

I really only did this for Twitter followers....
